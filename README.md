# MiniProject-AadharCensusDataValidation

A small code to validate the Census data on the basis of Aadhar Data. What this project does is that, it takes Aadhar data and calculates the total number of male and female population per state.
This information can be taken and matched with the census data, thereby by making the following cases:
### Case I:
Aadhar Data results are greater than census results: Fake Aadhar are issued
### Case II:
Aadhar Data results are less than census results: Aadhar cards are not issued(in that particular state), campaign need revamp.
### Case III:
Difference between Aadhar Data results and census data results are less than a chosen threshold: Everything good to go.

#### Sample Data Result:
